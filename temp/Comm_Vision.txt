By 2030 we want Birmingham to be a uniquely special place where everyone has a great start to life, people live healthy and fulfilling lives, are enabled to achieve their full potential and contribute to their community, and no one is left behind.

Our ambitions for people are:

Children and young people are safe and feel safe and confident.
Everyone benefits from education, skills and employment opportunities that help them succeed in life.
Everyone lives healthy, active and fulfilling lives, and makes good choices about their wellbeing.
Everyone gets the health and social care support and information they need at the right time and place.
Communities are welcoming and supportive, especially of those most in need, and people feel able to contribute to community life.
We want our county's economy to be strong, vibrant and successful and Birmingham to be a great place to live, work and learn. A place that capitalises on its location and natural assets, and where communities feel supported and people are able to support each other.

Our ambitions for our place are:

Residents live in clean, safe and green communities, where people and organisations embrace their environmental responsibilities.
Journeys across the county are easier, more predictable and safer.
Everyone has a place they can call home, with appropriate housing for all.
Businesses in Birmingham thrive.
Well connected communities, with effective infrastructure, that grow sustainably
