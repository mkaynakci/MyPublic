Introduction 

 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force in the global economy, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and economic growth. As ABC, we recognise the potential of AI to enhance our services, improve our operational efficiency, and deliver better outcomes for our residents. This AI strategy is our roadmap for harnessing the power of AI to achieve our objectives and priorities, and to address the unique challenges we face as a council. 

 

The ABC serves a diverse population of 1.2 million residents, with a strong economy worth £43.5 billion. However, we face a range of challenges, from a growing and ageing population, health inequalities, and the impacts of climate change, to the need for sustainable economic growth, tackling cost of living issues, and ensuring the provision of high-quality and sustainable services for all. 

 

Our council's objectives and priorities, as outlined in our Organisation Strategy and Birmingham Way (2023 to 2028), are focused on addressing these challenges. We aim to grow a sustainable economy so everyone can benefit, tackle health inequality, enable a greener future, and empower thriving communities. We are committed to delivering excellence in our services and continually improving our organisational capability. 


 

In this context, AI offers significant potential to help us achieve our objectives and priorities. For example, AI can help us improve service delivery by automating routine tasks, enhancing decision-making, and personalising services. It can also help us improve our operational efficiency by optimising resource allocation, streamlining processes, and enhancing performance monitoring. Furthermore, AI can help us address our challenges by providing insights into complex issues, predicting future trends, and enabling innovative solutions. 

 

However, harnessing the power of AI is not without its challenges. These include the need for significant investment in AI technology and skills, the need to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI, and the need to manage the impacts of AI on our workforce and our residents. Our AI strategy is designed to address these challenges, guided by the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. 

 


 

In developing this strategy, we have drawn on the UK National AI Strategy, which provides a national framework for the development and use of AI, and the ABC Organisation Strategy, which outlines our council's objectives and priorities. 

 

Birmingham Way defines the key areas that we should be working towards. The AI strategy aligns with the priorities and objectives of the organisation as follows.

Understanding AI 

 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that involves the development of machines and software that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language and speech, recognising patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. 

 

AI technologies include machine learning, where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed; natural language processing, which enables computers to understand and generate human language; and computer vision, which enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world.  

 
 

At ABC we have already started using AI in several initiatives including developing chatbots’ intents and training them with conversational data, developing machine learning models in social care to analyse the trends and predict demand, prioritise urgent enquiries based on emergency. With the recent advancement in AI, particularly in Generative AI, the possibilities of what we can achieve has been greatly enhanced.  

 

AI has the potential to deliver significant benefits for the ABC and our residents. Some of these include: 

 

Improved Service Delivery and Resident Experience: AI can help us deliver more efficient, effective, and personalised services. For example, AI can be used as in the chatbots to answer common queries or process payments and applications, freeing up our staff to focus on more complex and value-added tasks. 

 

Increased Operational Efficiency: AI can help us improve our operational efficiency by optimising our resource allocation, streamlining our processes, and enhancing our performance monitoring. For example, AI can help us predict demand for our services, optimise our workforce scheduling, and monitor our performance in real-time in social care. 

New Working Models and Service Innovation: AI can enable us to innovate and transform our services, our operations, and our ways of working. For example, AI can enable us to develop new services, such as virtual assistants or predictive maintenance systems, and new ways of working, such as data-driven decision-making, creating or finding the content and presenting it in a concise and consistent manner. 

 

Enhanced Decision-Making: AI can help us make better decisions by providing insights into complex issues, predicting future trends, and simulating the impacts of different options. For example, AI can help us identify patterns and trends in our social care or financial data that can inform our strategies and policies. Although this is the level where we want to reach our ambition, we are far from this maturity.  

 

 

Additionally, 

 

AI can aid in data-driven decision making for policy and planning, helping to ensure resources are allocated effectively and policies are designed to meet the needs of all residents. The challenge here is ensuring the AI system has access to accurate and comprehensive data, and that it is programmed to consider all relevant factors and potential impacts of decisions. 

Generative AI can help in automating content creation for public communications, ensuring information is disseminated quickly and effectively. The challenge is to ensure the AI-generated content is accurate, relevant and understandable to all residents, and that it maintains a consistent tone and style  

Speech and voice recognition technologies can greatly enhance accessibility services for residents, allowing them to interact with digital services using voice commands. The challenge is to ensure these technologies can accurately understand and respond to a wide range of voices and accents and can operate effectively in noisy environments. 

Computer vision or image recognition can help in automated monitoring and maintenance of public spaces, quickly identifying potential safety hazards or instances of vandalism. The challenge is to ensure these systems respect privacy rights and are not used for unwarranted surveillance. They must also be able to operate effectively in different lighting and weather conditions, and accurately identify a wide range of objects and situations. 

Predictive Analytics: Using AI to predict future trends and issues can help Birmingham become a proactive county that anticipates and responds to the needs of its residents. This could be used in areas like healthcare, social services, and infrastructure planning. The challenge is to ensure predictions are accurate and based on comprehensive and up-to-date data. 

AI in Education: AI could be used to personalise education and support lifelong learning, helping Birmingham become a place where everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow. This could include AI tutors, adaptive learning platforms, and AI tools to support teachers. The challenge is to ensure these technologies are accessible to all and do not replace the human touch in education. 

 

 

 

On the other hand, harnessing the power of AI also presents challenges. These include: 

 

Investment: Developing and implementing AI requires significant investment in technology, data, and skills. This includes the cost of AI software and hardware for computing, the cost of collecting, cleaning, and managing data, and the cost of training our staff to use AI. 

 

Ethics and Responsibility: Using AI raises ethical and responsibility issues, such as the potential for bias in AI decisions, the impact of AI on privacy and data security, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI decision-making. These are addressed in data and AI governance frameworks that we have started developing.  

 

Workforce Impact: AI can impact our workforce by automating certain tasks, requiring new skills, and changing ways of working. This requires us to manage the transition to an AI-enabled workforce, including retraining and re-skilling our staff, managing change, and ensuring the wellbeing of our staff. This should be addressed in our workforce strategy.  

 

Regulation and Governance: Using AI requires us to comply with regulations and governance frameworks, such as data protection laws, AI ethics guidelines, and IT governance standards. This requires us to develop and implement appropriate policies, procedures, and controls. 

 

 

This AI strategy aims to harness the benefits of AI while addressing the ABC’ challenges, guided by our principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. We are committed to using AI to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes, while ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI, the wellbeing of our workforce, and the trust and confidence of our residents. 

 

 

Our Vision for AI 

 

We have conducted several workshops with stakeholders from representatives from different directorates in the organisation, our councillors, to understand the needs to help us to set our vision for AI. Our vision for AI in the ABC is to harness the power of AI to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes, in line with our council's objectives and priorities, and in alignment with the UK National AI Strategy. 

 

We envision a future where AI is an integral part of our council, enhancing our service delivery, improving our operational efficiency, informing our decision-making, and driving our innovation. We see AI as a tool that can help us achieve our objectives of growing a sustainable economy, tackling health inequality, enabling a greener future, and empowering thriving communities. 

 

 

In line with the UK National AI Strategy, our data strategy and Information Governance (IG) guidelines,  we are committed to developing and using AI in a way that is ethical, fair, and transparent. We believe that AI should be used for the benefit of all our residents, that the benefits and risks of AI should be shared equitably, and that the use of AI should be transparent and accountable. 

 

Our vision for AI includes the following key elements: 

 
 

Enhanced Services: We aim to use AI to deliver more efficient, effective, and personalised services. This includes using AI to automate routine tasks like in RPA, but also personalise services based on individual needs and preferences and provide real-time information and support to our residents. 

Informed Decision-Making: We aim to use AI to inform our decision-making. This includes using AI to analyse our data, predict future trends, simulate the impacts of different options, and provide insights into complex issues. 

Driven Efficiency: We aim to use AI to improve our operational efficiency. This includes using AI to optimise our resource allocation, streamline our processes, and enhance our performance monitoring. 

Service Innovation: We aim to use AI to drive our innovation in the services and the products. This includes using AI to develop new services, new ways of working, and new solutions to our challenges. 

AI-Enabled Workforce: We aim to develop an AI-enabled workforce. This includes training our staff to use AI, retraining and reskilling our staff for AI-impacted roles, and promoting a culture of learning and innovation. 

Ethical Use: We aim to use AI ethically and responsibly. This includes ensuring the privacy and security of our data, avoiding bias in our AI decisions, and being transparent and accountable in our use of AI. 

 

In pursuing this vision, we are committed to working with our staff, our residents, our partners, and other stakeholders. We believe that by harnessing the power of AI, we can make our council more efficient, more effective, and more responsive, and deliver better outcomes for our residents. 

 

In the words of our Chief Executive, Joanna Killian, AI could be the solution to the workforce crisis, presenting an "almost existential" challenge for the sector. As she stated in her recent blog post, "Controlled, responsive, controllable artificial intelligence could make a difference on some of the processing we do where, again, we just can’t find the workers to do it." 

 

She also highlighted the need for local government to help set the ethical framework for using AI, stating, "We will invest in the moral and ethical conversations and then blooming go for it, because I can’t see what the alternative is.". This aligns with our commitment to ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI 

 


Guiding Principles 

 

Our AI principles are the guiding values that will inform all AI activities within the ABC. These principles are designed to ensure that our use of AI aligns with our organisational values, strategic goals, and legal requirements, and that it respects the rights and interests of our residents, our staff, and other stakeholders. 

 

Our AI principles are based on the Data Ethics Framework and the AI Policy that we have started developing with data strategy and Information Governance (IG) teams, and they align with the organisation strategy, and IG data relevant guidelines and standards. 

 
 

Fairness: We will use AI in ways that are fair and that avoid unjust biases. We will seek to eliminate any potential for our AI projects to have unintended discriminatory effects on individuals and social groups. 

Transparency: We will ensure that our AI technologies are transparent. Their purpose, capacities, and limitations will be openly communicated to relevant stakeholders. We will also make our AI projects and processes transparent and open to inspection. 

Accountability: We will be accountable for the AI technologies we deploy and use. Clear responsibilities and accountabilities will be established and maintained throughout their lifecycle. We will also ensure that our AI decisions can be explained and justified. 

 

In addition to these 3 principles coming from data ethics framework AI strategy added these after workshops with our stakeholders

In the maturity roadmap a stage gate approach is suggested to provide a structured process for managing the development and implementation of our AI initiatives. Each phase of the roadmap represents a stage of AI maturity, with specific objectives and success metrics. At the end of each phase, a gate decision is made based on whether the success metrics have been met and whether the risks associated with the next phase are deemed manageable. The possible gate decisions are "Go" (proceed to the next phase), "Kill" (terminate the project), "Hold" (pause the project), and "Conditional Go" (proceed to the next phase with specific issues to be addressed). This stage gate process ensures that our AI initiatives are effectively managed and aligned with our objectives and priorities, and that risks are identified and addressed at each stage of development. It provides a clear path for progression, while allowing for flexibility and adaptability in response to changing circumstances and learnings from each phase. 

 

The first phase of stage gate maturity roadmap will give us the opportunity to review our progress against the success metrics and risks associated with using AI in the organisation with internal use cases before we invest and risk more. The gate decision is important for the AI strategy because it ensures that we are ready to move forward with implementation of AI in a broader context. It also ensures that we have built solid foundations in terms of governance, staff awareness, and initial prototyping, and that we are ready to invest more and to experiment with AI in a more extensive and potentially riskier context with external use cases. If we were to continue to the next stage without meeting the success metrics, we could face significant challenges and risks in the second phase.  

 

 

Use Cases 

 

Our AI use cases are practical applications of AI that we have identified to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes. This list is not exhaustive, and these use cases were selected based on their potential to deliver tangible benefits and outcomes in terms of improved service delivery, cost savings, and customer experience, and their alignment with our council's objectives and priorities.  

 


ABC Resources: Automating routine tasks such as data entry, email generation, and appointment management. This can free up staff time for more complex tasks. As a next phase, AI can be used to generate documents, such as reports, slide decks, emails based on data. AI can also be used to manage casework, helping to prioritise tasks, follow up and track progress. 

 

Social Care (ASC and CFLL): The chatbots that we have implemented are providing 24/7 support, handling routine enquiry, freeing up human resources, and reducing costs. Predictive analytics can identify at-risk individuals, improving intervention efficiency. For example, AI can analyse data from various sources (LAS, LCS, schools- Synergy, Eyes etc) to identify individuals who are at high risk of social issues, enabling early intervention and potentially preventing crises. 

 

Personalised Care Packages: AI can utilise predictive models to create personalised care packages in adult and children's social care, enhancing service quality while optimising resource allocation. This can help to provide more targeted and effective care, reducing unnecessary costs and improving outcomes for individuals. 

 

Road and Transport Maintenance: Machine Learning predictive analytics can pre-empt maintenance needs, saving on maintenance costs. For example, AI can analyse data from various sources to predict infrastructure issues such as potholes on roads. By predicting these issues before they become severe, the council can perform preventative maintenance, leading to cost savings in the long run. 

 

Emergency Planning & Community Safety: Monitor emails and transcripts of voice, freeing up human resources. Generative AI (CoIilot,ChatGPT) can synthesise reports quickly, reducing administrative costs. For example, AI can analyse emails and voice channels to detect potential safety issues, enabling early intervention and potentially preventing accidents or crimes. 

 

Health, Welfare & Wellbeing Support: For tracking health trends and identifying needs for welfare services, improving resource allocation. For example, AI can analyse health data to identify individuals who are at high risk of health issues, enabling early intervention and potentially preventing health crises. 

 

These use cases are just the beginning. As we continue to develop our AI capabilities and learn from our AI initiatives, we expect to identify additional use cases that can deliver even greater benefits for the council and our residents. Some of these additional use cases were defined in the use cases prism below. In this prism we have categorised use cases into four quadrants, based on their feasibility and business value.  

 

Sample Use Case: SEN Report Writing and Drafting with AI Capabilities 

Discovered by: Bryan Smith, Solutioned by: Mehmet Kaynakci   

Problem Statement:  

Special education needs (SEN) report writing requires the consolidation of information from various sources, including Assessment Psychologists, referred GPs, and social care professionals. Manually gathering, analysing, and summarizing this information is time-consuming and can lead to inconsistencies or omissions in the final report.  

Potential Solution:  

Leverage Azure, OpenAI's ChatGPT capabilities, and UIPath RPA tools to create an AI-driven report writing system for SEN:  

Data Aggregation and Collection with RPA:  

In scenarios where data sources are diverse like in this case, and direct API integrations aren't feasible, our existing RPA tools can be employed. These tools can automate the process of extracting information from emails, legacy systems, and other non-API sources.  

Azure's data storage services can be used to store the aggregated information in a centralised location, ensuring all relevant data is easily accessible.  

Information Summarization: Utilise OpenAI's ChatGPT capabilities to read and understand the information from various sources. The AI can then generate concise summaries of the key points from each source.  

Report Generation: The AI system can be trained to understand the structure and requirements of the SEN report. Using this knowledge, it can automatically fill in the relevant sections of the report with the summarized information.  

Review & Finalization: Once the AI generates the draft report, staff can review and make any necessary adjustments, ensuring the final report is accurate and meets the required standards.  

Continuous Learning: The AI system can learn from feedback and corrections made by the staff, ensuring that its future report generations are even more accurate and tailored to the organization's needs.  

Benefits:  

Efficiency: Automating the data aggregation and report generation processes can significantly reduce the time taken to produce SEN reports. Staff can focus on reviewing and finalizing reports rather than spending hours manually compiling them.  

Consistency: AI-driven report generation ensures that all reports maintain a consistent format and quality.  

Accuracy: By leveraging AI and RPA tools, the chances of omitting crucial details or misplacing information are minimized.  

Benefits to Residents: Faster report generation means that residents and their guardians receive timely updates and interventions. Accurate and comprehensive reports ensure that the special education needs of the residents are adequately addressed.  

Organisational Benefits: The organisation benefits from improved staff satisfaction, reduced manual errors, and the ability to handle a larger volume of reports without compromising on quality.  

 

 

 

Funding Options for the use cases and initiatives in Roadmap 

The strategy considers some options for funding AI initiative and use cases  

Bid for the Fund of Overall AI Program: 

We made a comprehensive bid to finance to be submitted to Cabinet and CLT to secure funding for a potential AI program, covering all anticipated costs for the next three years.  With this model we provided clarity on the budget required and we plan to have the necessary financial backing from the outset for initiatives within the AI strategy.  

 

With secured funding, we can confidently initiate the foundational steps, such as setting up the safe environment for potential ideas and trials, establishing governance structures, and beginning pilot projects. 

 

As the AI initiatives scale up in upcoming years, we can invest in more advanced tools, technologies, and training without financial constraints. This ensures smooth execution of projects like expanding AI use cases and integrating AI into business processes. 

 

Charge Back to Services: 

 

We propose a centralized fund or "pot" is established for AI-related initiatives within IT&D. The pot is contributed by services based on their projected use of IT&D resources and AI capabilities. As these services utilise the AI resources or require support, costs are charged back to them from the pot. This model ensures that departments are directly accountable for their AI initiatives, promotes efficient use of IT&D resources, and ensures that the digital programme within IT&D remains self-sustaining. 

  

As foundational structures in Year 1 are set up, services contribute to the pot based on their anticipated AI needs and use cases identified. They are then charged for initial projects, training, and IT&D support. This ensures that departments are financially prepared for their AI journey and incentivises them to plan efficiently. 

 

As AI initiatives expand, services continue to contribute based on their scaling needs. They are charged based on the complexity, scale, and IT&D support their projects require. This will then promote responsible scaling and ensures that IT&D resources are allocated where they have the most impact. 

 

This charge back model, aligned with the digital program, can ensure that the AI initiatives are closely tied to the actual needs and financial capabilities of the services. It promotes a culture of responsibility, planning, and efficient use of resources. 

 

 

Additional Funding Options Considered: 

Grants and External Funding: We will explore opportunities for grants from UK government, international organisations, or research institutions or programmes that support AI initiatives. 

Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): We are considering collaboration with private sector companies to co-fund AI initiatives. This can bring in external expertise and reduce the financial burden on ABC. 

Revenue Sharing with Vendors: We will engage with some existing and potential suppliers or vendors on a revenue-sharing basis. This can reduce upfront costs and align vendor interests with the success of the AI programme. 

 

For a risk-averse yet ambitious organization like ABC, the charge back model is suggested as it can offer the right balance between fiscal responsibility and the pursuit of innovative AI initiatives. There are several reasons for favouring charge back model 

 

Financial Accountability: Each service will be directly accountable for its AI initiatives. By charging services based on their actual usage or the resources they consume, it will promote a sense of ownership and responsibility. Services are more likely to be wise in their use of AI resources, ensuring that projects align with genuine needs and deliver outcomes for residents and staff. 

Budget Predictability: The charge back model can offer a level of predictability in budgeting. Services contribute to the centralized pot based on their projected needs, allowing for better financial planning. This is particularly appealing to risk-averse organizations like ABC that prioritise fiscal responsibility. 

Efficient Use of Resources: Since services are charged based on their consumption of resources, there's an inherent incentive to use resources efficiently. This can lead to better project scoping, prioritization of high-impact initiatives, and a focus on achieving tangible outcomes. 

Self-sustaining IT&D BAU and Transformation program: The model can help IT&D and digital programme remaining self-sustaining, as it operates based on the funds contributed by the services. This will reduce the need for external funding or budgetary allocations, which can be challenging to secure in short term. 

Alignment with Ambition: Some services might be more ambitious than others. The model will give more opportunity to the ones that wish to pursue ambitious AI projects can do so, provided they contribute accordingly to the pot. 

Transparency: The charge back model offers transparency in how funds are used. Services can see how their contributions are being utilised 

Flexibility to Scale: The charge back model can allow for flexibility in scaling AI initiatives. If a service sees positive outcomes from its initial AI projects and wishes to expand, it can adjust its contributions to the pot accordingly. 

AI Governance Framework 

 

While control and risk management are undeniably important with a governance, especially in the rapidly changing context of AI, we aim a better governance that doesn’t hinder ABC's potential. A balanced approach that prioritizes innovation and growth, while also considering risks, is essential for organizations to fully harness the transformative power of AI for the serve our residents better and build a better future workforce. 

 

ABC operates under tight budgetary constraints and budget gap requires a critical attention. By focusing on growth and innovation, ABC can identify cost-saving opportunities faster and allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring maximum value for residents. Additionally, an innovation-focused governance will allow ABC to leverage AI to improve our services and customer experience, making them more efficient and user-friendly. 

 

AI Governance Framework outlines the structures, processes, and principles we will use to ensure that our AI initiatives are ethical, responsible, and compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. This framework is based on the Data Ethics Framework by involvement of IG and data teams, and it aligns with the UK National AI Strategy, Organisational Strategy, Digital Strategy, Data Strategy and other relevant guidelines and standards. 

 

We emphasize leveraging existing governance processes including DPIA, SRA and data ethics framework because  

Building upon established processes reduces the time and resources required to develop a new framework from scratch.  

Using existing processes ensures alignment with the organization's current values, principles, and operational standards. 

Stakeholders feel more familiar with a governance framework that builds upon known and accepted processes. 

Reinventing the wheel can lead to duplication of efforts and potential conflicts with existing processes. 

How existing frameworks are understood and used in this governance is explained below 

Data Ethics Framework: ABC data ethics framework designed and owned by data team, and it provides guiding principles, guidelines on the moral implications and responsibilities around utilising data and AI in ABC.  As far as AI domain is concerned, AI ethical considerations and governance framework builds upon data ethics framework to define the principles and guidelines. As outlined in the document , data ethics framework also applies to AI projects. As the document appreciates, AI is a fast moving field and there are novel applications and potential challenges – this will mean that there are particular ethical dimensions to AI projects, where AI governance will define and guide.  

In summary, AI governance framework doesn't operate in isolation. It appreciates and acknowledges the importance of the data ethics framework. For AI projects, the guiding principles and guidelines of the data ethics framework are still applicable. This ensures consistency in ethical considerations, whether it's a data project or an AI project.   

Data Protection Impact Assessment: DPIA is the process designed and owned by IG team to help ABC services systematically analyse, identify, and minimize the data protection risks of a project or system. It focuses specifically on assessing the impact on personal data protection. 

Security Risk Assessment: SRA is the process that is owned by IT&D and helps identify, assess, and prioritize risks related to information security. It focuses on potential threats to data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. 

Data Ethics Framework also defines the process how the DPIA and SRA is integrated into the governance process. When it comes to existing processes such as DPIA and SRA, the AI governance framework will primarily rely on the processes defined by the data ethics framework. This is because the foundational principles of data protection and security remain consistent, whether we're discussing data or AI. However, given the unique challenges posed by AI – such as the generative AI, black-box nature of certain algorithms, potential biases in AI models, or the dynamic learning capabilities of AI systems – there might be specific domains where the AI governance framework will introduce additional guidelines or checks. These will be to ensure that the AI-specific challenges are adequately addressed without compromising on the ethical and security standards set by the data ethics framework. 

 

What Innovation & Growth Focus means for ABC within AI Strategy Context: 

  

Prioritise projects and use cases that have the potential for significant innovation, growth and savings. Encourage teams to experiment and take calculated risks. 

Linked with an AI Community of Innovation (CoI) where teams can collaborate, experiment, and develop new AI solutions at pace. 

 

AI Governance Working Group (WG): 

 

We have started to establish a working group responsible for overseeing AI governance within the ABC. This group is responsible for overseeing AI governance. They ensure that AI activities align with guiding principles, comply with relevant laws and regulations, and promote best practices. They also monitor AI-related risks and incidents and foster an environment of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous learning. 

  

Short term objectives of WG

Implementation Models Considered: 

  

Decentralised Model: Services have autonomy over their projects and tools. Although this might seem to promote agility and innovation but may lead to increased costs (shadow IT), duplication and inconsistencies and risks. 

Centralised Model: A single team or entity makes decisions. This ensures better consistency and compliance but may slow down decision-making. 

Hub and Spoke Model: A central team (hub) provides guidelines, and individual teams (spokes) work on their projects. This model combines the benefits of both centralised and decentralised models. 

 

Proposed Model:  

 

It is proposed in this strategy that The Hub and Spoke model will be more suitable for ABC that combines the benefits of both centralised and decentralised model and to use our resources (human and technology) efficiently. The WG group (hub) with can ensure that best practices are followed, and resources are allocated efficiently. The individual teams (spokes) can then focus on their projects, ensuring agility and innovation. With the Hub and Spoke model, the central team can develop specialized AI models that can be used by multiple teams. This ensures that resources are used efficiently and that there's consistency in the AI solutions developed.

Conclusion 

 

 

We believe that AI has the potential to transform our services and operations, and to deliver significant improvements in service delivery, cost savings, and innovation aligned with our digital strategy 2025. 

 

As outlined in our AI strategy, we believe that AI can play a significant role in achieving the council’s key priorities of growing a sustainable economy, tackling health inequality, enabling a greener future, and empowering communities aligned with our organisational strategy and Birmingham Way initiative. It is also designed to use the potential of AI to improve services and outcomes for our residents, and to address workforce challenges while also addressing the challenges and risks associated with AI, referring to Jo Killian’s comments.  

 

It is guided by our vision for AI, which is to use AI to drive innovation, improve service delivery, reduce costs, and promote a culture of continuous learning and improvement. It also addresses using AI in a way that is ethical, inclusive, transparent, and accountable with data ethics framework that we are developing. 

 

The strategy is underpinned by a robust stage gate maturity roadmap, which provides a structured process for managing the development and risks associated with AI initiatives. This roadmap, with its clear success metrics and gate decisions, ensures that our AI initiatives are effectively managed and aligned with our objectives and priorities, and that risks are identified and addressed at each stage of development. 

 

The roadmap demonstrates our commitment to a responsible and phased approach to AI adoption, starting with building trust and planning with internal use, moving to experimenting with external use cases, then scaling up to more services, and finally reaching an advanced phase where AI is fully integrated into our operations and decision-making processes. 

 

We are fostering a pro-innovation approach, encouraging our staff to innovate and experiment with AI by establishing a Community of innovation and a safe platform for prototyping use cases. We believe that this will drive creativity and efficiency within the council, leading to improved services for our residents. At the same time, we will be addressing risks and concerns through a robust governance framework that is emerging alongside our AI initiatives.  

 

We look forward to working with our staff, our residents, our partners, and other stakeholders to implement this strategy and to use the power of AI for the benefit of our council and our community. We are excited about the opportunities that AI presents, and we are committed to exploring these opportunities in a way that is ethical, responsible, and focused on delivering value and benefits for our residents.
