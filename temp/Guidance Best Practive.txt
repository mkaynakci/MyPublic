1- Start inside. Before using generative AI to create customer- or other external-facing content, test extensively with internal stakeholders and employee use cases. We don’t want hallucinations to harm business.
2- Prize transparency. Be forthcoming with people, whether they be staff, customers or citizens, about the fact that they are interacting with a machine by clearly labelling any conversation throughout.
3- Do due diligence. Set up processes and guardrails to track biases and other issues of trustworthiness. Do so by validating results and continually testing for the model going off course.
4- Address privacy and security concerns. Ensure that sensitive data is neither input nor derived. Confirm with the model provider that this data won’t be used for machine learning beyond our organisation.
5- Take it slow. Keep functionality in beta for an extended period of time. This helps temper expectations for perfect results.
