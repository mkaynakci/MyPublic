Our AI Maturity and Investment Roadmap outlines the phased approach we will take to develop and implement AI in the SCC. This roadmap is designed to ensure that our AI initiatives are well-planned, well-managed, and well-governed, and that they deliver tangible benefits in terms of improved service delivery, cost savings, and innovation. 

 

The roadmap consists of four phases:  

 

Phase 1 - Year 1 (0-12 months): Planning and Building Trust Phase.  

 

This phase will lay the foundation for future AI initiatives and building the trust with refinement of some internal use cases delivered. This will be achieved via emerging AI  governance working group and community of innovation (CoI), conduct AI awareness workshops, identify sample use cases with AI CoI, develop the AI governance framework with the data team, prototype some use cases in registration, highways and land & property services, and collaborate with the University of Surrey in prototype projects. We will also begin to foster a culture of change within the organisation, preparing our staff for the integration of AI into our operations. The investment required in this phase includes AI training for the squad, AI awareness hackathons, building or purchasing a safe platform for prototyping use cases, and resources for implementing the AI governance framework. 

 

Phase 2 - Year 2 (12-24 months): Experimenting Phase.  

 

This phase will start to deliver tangible benefits in terms of improved service delivery and cost savings. We will pilot selected use cases in some key initiatives, integrate AI with our chatbot platform and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), upskill the data analytics and automation teams, and increase collaboration with more universities. We will also continue to manage organisational change and ensure regulatory compliance as we experiment with AI. The investment required in this phase includes AI tools, infrastructure for piloting use cases, a data warehouse and data lakes, and hiring a data engineer and a data scientist to develop models. 

 

Phase 3 - Year 3 (24-36 months): Scaling Up Phase.  

 

This phase will deliver further improvements in service delivery and cost savings. We will apply more use cases to other services, develop new AI solutions based on lessons learned from pilot projects, strengthen collaboration with external partners including D&Bs and Police and NHS, integrate AI with residents' channels including voice and chatbot, and refine the AI governance framework based on implementation experiences. We will also focus on managing the cultural and organisational changes associated with scaling up AI, and ensure ongoing regulatory compliance. The investment required in this phase includes continued investment in AI tools and infrastructure, hiring additional data engineers and data scientists, and hiring a Machine Learning (ML) engineer to support and maintain models. 

 

Phase 4 - Year 4+ (36+ months): Advanced Phase.  

 

This phase will deliver significant long-term benefits in terms of improved service delivery, cost savings, and innovation for the council. We will fully integrate AI into the council's operations and decision-making processes, continuously innovate and adopt cutting-edge AI technologies, and establish the SCC as a leading example of AI-driven local government. We will also focus on managing the cultural and organisational changes associated with advanced AI use, and ensure ongoing regulatory compliance. The investment required in this phase includes continued investment in AI tools and infrastructure, hiring additional data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, and setting aside a budget for the purchase of new tech.
