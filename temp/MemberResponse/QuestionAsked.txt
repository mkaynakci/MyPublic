You will be aware that that OpenAI is one of three companies known to be spending billions on producing Artificial Intelligence (AI) products.

OpenAI has this year released its ChatGPT-4 system for free use or with additional benefits for a small monthly fee.

This system will generate texts, provide information and answer questions with very little prompt information.

The Chief Executive Officer of OpenAI has said that training this AI Chatbot cost $100 million.

In view of this situation, by which AI systems developed by huge numbers of staff and huge costs are becoming available for both free and rented use, 
is it really a wise move for Surrey County Council to attempt to produce its own bespoke AI systems?
