We are in the progressive stages of developing a comprehensive AI strategy for the council with a focus on balancing opportunities and risks. We will do this with an initial focus on

building trust with our residents and staff with a roadmap embedded in the strategy
providing a policy framework, guiding staff on use of GenAI models for internal processes and resident facing activities.
 

While there is no intention to replicate the capabilities of commercially available GenAI platforms, we appreciate the need of mechanisms that ensure our and residentsâ€™ sensitive data is kept separate from commercially available Gen AI products and tailored models for specific use cases with better accuracy.

 

Our collaboration with University of Surrey will continue to address ethical aspect of AI and to deepen our understanding of the opportunities and limitations. That includes designing a delivery model with the university particularly when additional resources are required.
