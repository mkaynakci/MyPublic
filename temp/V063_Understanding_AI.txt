Understanding AI 

 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that involves the development of machines and software that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language and speech, recognising patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. 

 

AI technologies include machine learning, where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed; natural language processing, which enables computers to understand and generate human language; and computer vision, which enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world.  

 
 

At ABC we have already started using AI in several initiatives including developing chatbots’ intents and training them with conversational data, developing machine learning models in social care to analyse the trends and predict demand, prioritise urgent enquiries based on emergency. With the recent advancement in AI, particularly in Generative AI, the possibilities of what we can achieve has been greatly enhanced.  

 

AI has the potential to deliver significant benefits for the ABC and our residents. Some of these include: 

 

Improved Service Delivery and Resident Experience: AI can help us deliver more efficient, effective, and personalised services. For example, AI can be used as in the chatbots to answer common queries or process payments and applications, freeing up our staff to focus on more complex and value-added tasks. 

 

Increased Operational Efficiency: AI can help us improve our operational efficiency by optimising our resource allocation, streamlining our processes, and enhancing our performance monitoring. For example, AI can help us predict demand for our services, optimise our workforce scheduling, and monitor our performance in real-time in social care. 

New Working Models and Service Innovation: AI can enable us to innovate and transform our services, our operations, and our ways of working. For example, AI can enable us to develop new services, such as virtual assistants or predictive maintenance systems, and new ways of working, such as data-driven decision-making, creating or finding the content and presenting it in a concise and consistent manner. 

 

Enhanced Decision-Making: AI can help us make better decisions by providing insights into complex issues, predicting future trends, and simulating the impacts of different options. For example, AI can help us identify patterns and trends in our social care or financial data that can inform our strategies and policies. Although this is the level where we want to reach our ambition, we are far from this maturity.  

 

 

Additionally, 

 

AI can aid in data-driven decision making for policy and planning, helping to ensure resources are allocated effectively and policies are designed to meet the needs of all residents. The challenge here is ensuring the AI system has access to accurate and comprehensive data, and that it is programmed to consider all relevant factors and potential impacts of decisions. 

Generative AI can help in automating content creation for public communications, ensuring information is disseminated quickly and effectively. The challenge is to ensure the AI-generated content is accurate, relevant and understandable to all residents, and that it maintains a consistent tone and style  

Speech and voice recognition technologies can greatly enhance accessibility services for residents, allowing them to interact with digital services using voice commands. The challenge is to ensure these technologies can accurately understand and respond to a wide range of voices and accents and can operate effectively in noisy environments. 

Computer vision or image recognition can help in automated monitoring and maintenance of public spaces, quickly identifying potential safety hazards or instances of vandalism. The challenge is to ensure these systems respect privacy rights and are not used for unwarranted surveillance. They must also be able to operate effectively in different lighting and weather conditions, and accurately identify a wide range of objects and situations. 

Predictive Analytics: Using AI to predict future trends and issues can help Birmingham become a proactive county that anticipates and responds to the needs of its residents. This could be used in areas like healthcare, social services, and infrastructure planning. The challenge is to ensure predictions are accurate and based on comprehensive and up-to-date data. 

AI in Education: AI could be used to personalise education and support lifelong learning, helping Birmingham become a place where everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow. This could include AI tutors, adaptive learning platforms, and AI tools to support teachers. The challenge is to ensure these technologies are accessible to all and do not replace the human touch in education. 

 

 

 

On the other hand, harnessing the power of AI also presents challenges. These include: 

 

Investment: Developing and implementing AI requires significant investment in technology, data, and skills. This includes the cost of AI software and hardware for computing, the cost of collecting, cleaning, and managing data, and the cost of training our staff to use AI. 

 

Ethics and Responsibility: Using AI raises ethical and responsibility issues, such as the potential for bias in AI decisions, the impact of AI on privacy and data security, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI decision-making. These are addressed in data and AI governance frameworks that we have started developing.  

 

Workforce Impact: AI can impact our workforce by automating certain tasks, requiring new skills, and changing ways of working. This requires us to manage the transition to an AI-enabled workforce, including retraining and re-skilling our staff, managing change, and ensuring the wellbeing of our staff. This should be addressed in our workforce strategy.  

 

Regulation and Governance: Using AI requires us to comply with regulations and governance frameworks, such as data protection laws, AI ethics guidelines, and IT governance standards. This requires us to develop and implement appropriate policies, procedures, and controls. 

 

 

This AI strategy aims to harness the benefits of AI while addressing the ABC’ challenges, guided by our principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. We are committed to using AI to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes, while ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI, the wellbeing of our workforce, and the trust and confidence of our residents.
