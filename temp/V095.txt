Understanding AI 

 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that involves the development of machines and software that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from experience, understanding natural language and speech, recognising patterns, solving problems, and making decisions. 

 

AI technologies include machine learning, where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed; natural language processing, which enables computers to understand and generate human language; and computer vision, which enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world.  



At ABC we have already started using AI in several initiatives including developing chatbots’ intents and training them with conversational data, developing machine learning models in social care to analyse the trends and predict demand, prioritise urgent enquiries based on emergency. With the recent advancement in AI, particularly in Generative AI, the possibilities of what we can achieve has been greatly enhanced.  

 

AI has the potential to deliver significant benefits for the ABC and our residents. Some of these include: 

 

Improved Service Delivery and Resident Experience: AI can help us deliver more efficient, effective, and personalised services. For example, AI can be used as in the chatbots to answer common queries or process payments and applications, freeing up our staff to focus on more complex and value-added tasks. 

 

Increased Operational Efficiency: AI can help us improve our operational efficiency by optimising our resource allocation, streamlining our processes, and enhancing our performance monitoring. For example, AI can help us predict demand for our services, optimise our workforce scheduling, and monitor our performance in real-time in social care. 

New Working Models and Service Innovation: AI can enable us to innovate and transform our services, our operations, and our ways of working. For example, AI can enable us to develop new services, such as virtual assistants or predictive maintenance systems, and new ways of working, such as data-driven decision-making, creating or finding the content and presenting it in a concise and consistent manner. 

 

Enhanced Decision-Making: AI can help us make better decisions by providing insights into complex issues, predicting future trends, and simulating the impacts of different options. For example, AI can help us identify patterns and trends in our social care or financial data that can inform our strategies and policies. Although this is the level where we want to reach our ambition, we are far from this maturity.  

 

 

Additionally, 

 

AI can aid in data-driven decision making for policy and planning, helping to ensure resources are allocated effectively and policies are designed to meet the needs of all residents. The challenge here is ensuring the AI system has access to accurate and comprehensive data, and that it is programmed to consider all relevant factors and potential impacts of decisions. 

Generative AI can help in automating content creation for public communications, ensuring information is disseminated quickly and effectively. The challenge is to ensure the AI-generated content is accurate, relevant and understandable to all residents, and that it maintains a consistent tone and style  

Speech and voice recognition technologies can greatly enhance accessibility services for residents, allowing them to interact with digital services using voice commands. The challenge is to ensure these technologies can accurately understand and respond to a wide range of voices and accents and can operate effectively in noisy environments. 

Computer vision or image recognition can help in automated monitoring and maintenance of public spaces, quickly identifying potential safety hazards or instances of vandalism. The challenge is to ensure these systems respect privacy rights and are not used for unwarranted surveillance. They must also be able to operate effectively in different lighting and weather conditions, and accurately identify a wide range of objects and situations. 

Predictive Analytics: Using AI to predict future trends and issues can help Birmingham become a proactive county that anticipates and responds to the needs of its residents. This could be used in areas like healthcare, social services, and infrastructure planning. The challenge is to ensure predictions are accurate and based on comprehensive and up-to-date data. 

AI in Education: AI could be used to personalise education and support lifelong learning, helping Birmingham become a place where everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow. This could include AI tutors, adaptive learning platforms, and AI tools to support teachers. The challenge is to ensure these technologies are accessible to all and do not replace the human touch in education. 

 

 

 

On the other hand, harnessing the power of AI also presents challenges. These include: 

 

Investment: Developing and implementing AI requires significant investment in technology, data, and skills. This includes the cost of AI software and hardware for computing, the cost of collecting, cleaning, and managing data, and the cost of training our staff to use AI. 

 

Ethics and Responsibility: Using AI raises ethical and responsibility issues, such as the potential for bias in AI decisions, the impact of AI on privacy and data security, and the need for transparency and accountability in AI decision-making. These are addressed in data and AI governance frameworks that we have started developing.  

 

Workforce Impact: AI can impact our workforce by automating certain tasks, requiring new skills, and changing ways of working. This requires us to manage the transition to an AI-enabled workforce, including retraining and re-skilling our staff, managing change, and ensuring the wellbeing of our staff. This should be addressed in our workforce strategy.  

 

Regulation and Governance: Using AI requires us to comply with regulations and governance frameworks, such as data protection laws, AI ethics guidelines, and IT governance standards. This requires us to develop and implement appropriate policies, procedures, and controls. 

 

 

This AI strategy aims to harness the benefits of AI while addressing the ABC’ challenges, guided by our principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability. We are committed to using AI to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes, while ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI, the wellbeing of our workforce, and the trust and confidence of our residents. 

 

 

Our Vision for AI 

 

We have conducted several workshops with stakeholders from representatives from different directorates in the organisation, our councillors, to understand the needs to help us to set our vision for AI. Our vision for AI in the ABC is to harness the power of AI to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes, in line with our council's objectives and priorities, and in alignment with the UK National AI Strategy. 

 

We envision a future where AI is an integral part of our council, enhancing our service delivery, improving our operational efficiency, informing our decision-making, and driving our innovation. We see AI as a tool that can help us achieve our objectives of growing a sustainable economy, tackling health inequality, enabling a greener future, and empowering thriving communities. 

 

 

In line with the UK National AI Strategy, our data strategy and Information Governance (IG) guidelines,  we are committed to developing and using AI in a way that is ethical, fair, and transparent. We believe that AI should be used for the benefit of all our residents, that the benefits and risks of AI should be shared equitably, and that the use of AI should be transparent and accountable. 

 

Our vision for AI includes the following key elements: 

 
 

Enhanced Services: We aim to use AI to deliver more efficient, effective, and personalised services. This includes using AI to automate routine tasks like in RPA, but also personalise services based on individual needs and preferences and provide real-time information and support to our residents. 

Informed Decision-Making: We aim to use AI to inform our decision-making. This includes using AI to analyse our data, predict future trends, simulate the impacts of different options, and provide insights into complex issues. 

Driven Efficiency: We aim to use AI to improve our operational efficiency. This includes using AI to optimise our resource allocation, streamline our processes, and enhance our performance monitoring. 

Service Innovation: We aim to use AI to drive our innovation in the services and the products. This includes using AI to develop new services, new ways of working, and new solutions to our challenges. 

AI-Enabled Workforce: We aim to develop an AI-enabled workforce. This includes training our staff to use AI, retraining and reskilling our staff for AI-impacted roles, and promoting a culture of learning and innovation. 

Ethical Use: We aim to use AI ethically and responsibly. This includes ensuring the privacy and security of our data, avoiding bias in our AI decisions, and being transparent and accountable in our use of AI. 

 

In pursuing this vision, we are committed to working with our staff, our residents, our partners, and other stakeholders. We believe that by harnessing the power of AI, we can make our council more efficient, more effective, and more responsive, and deliver better outcomes for our residents. 

 

In the words of our Chief Executive, Joanna Killian, AI could be the solution to the workforce crisis, presenting an "almost existential" challenge for the sector. As she stated in her recent blog post, "Controlled, responsive, controllable artificial intelligence could make a difference on some of the processing we do where, again, we just can’t find the workers to do it." 

 

She also highlighted the need for local government to help set the ethical framework for using AI, stating, "We will invest in the moral and ethical conversations and then blooming go for it, because I can’t see what the alternative is.". This aligns with our commitment to ensuring the ethical and responsible use of AI 




Guiding Principles 

 

Our AI principles are the guiding values that will inform all AI activities within the ABC. These principles are designed to ensure that our use of AI aligns with our organisational values, strategic goals, and legal requirements, and that it respects the rights and interests of our residents, our staff, and other stakeholders. 

 

Our AI principles are based on the Data Ethics Framework and the AI Policy that we have started developing with data strategy and Information Governance (IG) teams, and they align with the organisation strategy, and IG data relevant guidelines and standards.

The group will ensure that our AI activities align with our principles, comply with all relevant laws and regulations, and promote best practices. The group will also monitor AI-related risks and incidents, and foster an environment of collaboration, inclusivity, and continuous learning around AI. 

 

 

AI Maturity and Investment Roadmap 

 

Our AI Maturity and Investment Roadmap outlines the phased approach we will take to develop and implement AI in the ABC. This roadmap is designed to ensure that our AI initiatives are well-planned, well-managed, and well-governed, and that they deliver tangible benefits in terms of improved service delivery, cost savings, and innovation. 

 

The roadmap consists of four phases:  

 

Phase 1 - Year 1 (0-12 months): Planning and Building Trust Phase.  

 

This phase will lay the foundation for future AI initiatives and building the trust with refinement of some internal use cases delivered. This will be achieved via emerging AI  governance working group and community of innovation (CoP), conduct AI awareness workshops, identify sample use cases with AI CoP, develop the AI governance framework with the data team, prototype some use cases in registration, highways and land & property services, and collaborate with the University of Birmingham in prototype projects. We will also begin to foster a culture of change within the organisation, preparing our staff for the integration of AI into our operations. The investment required in this phase includes AI training for the squad, AI awareness hackathons, building or purchasing a safe platform for prototyping use cases, and resources for implementing the AI governance framework. 

 

Phase 2 - Year 2 (12-24 months): Experimenting Phase.  

 

This phase will start to deliver tangible benefits in terms of improved service delivery and cost savings. We will pilot selected use cases in some key initiatives, integrate AI with our chatbot platform and Robotic Process Automation (RPA), upskill the data analytics and automation teams, and increase collaboration with more universities. We will also continue to manage organisational change and ensure regulatory compliance as we experiment with AI. The investment required in this phase includes AI tools, infrastructure for piloting use cases, a data warehouse and data lakes, and hiring a data engineer and a data scientist to develop models. 

 

Phase 3 - Year 3 (24-36 months): Scaling Up Phase.  

 

This phase will deliver further improvements in service delivery and cost savings. We will apply more use cases to other services, develop new AI solutions based on lessons learned from pilot projects, strengthen collaboration with external partners including D&Bs and Police and NHS, integrate AI with residents' channels including voice and chatbot, and refine the AI governance framework based on implementation experiences. We will also focus on managing the cultural and organisational changes associated with scaling up AI, and ensure ongoing regulatory compliance. The investment required in this phase includes continued investment in AI tools and infrastructure, hiring additional data engineers and data scientists, and hiring a Machine Learning (ML) engineer to support and maintain models. 

 

Phase 4 - Year 4+ (36+ months): Advanced Phase.  

 

This phase will deliver significant long-term benefits in terms of improved service delivery, cost savings, and innovation for the council. We will fully integrate AI into the council's operations and decision-making processes, continuously innovate and adopt cutting-edge AI technologies, and establish the ABC as a leading example of AI-driven local government. We will also focus on managing the cultural and organisational changes associated with advanced AI use, and ensure ongoing regulatory compliance. The investment required in this phase includes continued investment in AI tools and infrastructure, hiring additional data engineers, data scientists, and ML engineers, and setting aside a budget for the purchase of new tech. 

 

This roadmap is summarised in a table below and will be a living document, which will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect our evolving needs and priorities, the changing AI landscape, and the lessons we learn from our AI initiatives. We look forward to working with our staff, our residents, our partners, and other stakeholders to implement this roadmap and harness the power of AI to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes. 


In the maturity roadmap a stage gate approach is suggested to provide a structured process for managing the development and implementation of our AI initiatives. Each phase of the roadmap represents a stage of AI maturity, with specific objectives and success metrics. At the end of each phase, a gate decision is made based on whether the success metrics have been met and whether the risks associated with the next phase are deemed manageable. The possible gate decisions are "Go" (proceed to the next phase), "Kill" (terminate the project), "Hold" (pause the project), and "Conditional Go" (proceed to the next phase with specific issues to be addressed). This stage gate process ensures that our AI initiatives are effectively managed and aligned with our objectives and priorities, and that risks are identified and addressed at each stage of development. It provides a clear path for progression, while allowing for flexibility and adaptability in response to changing circumstances and learnings from each phase. 



The first phase of stage gate maturity roadmap will give us the opportunity to review our progress against the success metrics and risks associated with using AI in the organisation with internal use cases before we invest and risk more. The gate decision is important for the AI strategy because it ensures that we are ready to move forward with implementation of AI in a broader context. It also ensures that we have built solid foundations in terms of governance, staff awareness, and initial prototyping, and that we are ready to invest more and to experiment with AI in a more extensive and potentially riskier context with external use cases. If we were to continue to the next stage without meeting the success metrics, we could face significant challenges and risks in the second phase.  

 

 

Use Cases 

 

Our AI use cases are practical applications of AI that we have identified to improve our services, our operations, and our outcomes. These use cases have been selected based on their potential to deliver tangible benefits and outcomes in terms of improved service delivery, cost savings, and customer experience, and their alignment with our council's objectives and priorities.  

 

ABC Resources: Automating routine tasks such as data entry, email generation, and appointment management. This can free up staff time for more complex tasks. As a next phase, AI can be used to generate documents, such as reports, slide decks, emails based on data. AI can also be used to manage casework, helping to prioritise tasks, follow up and track progress. 

 

Social Care (ASC and CFLL): The chatbots that we have implemented are providing 24/7 support, handling routine enquiry, freeing up human resources, and reducing costs. Predictive analytics can identify at-risk individuals, improving intervention efficiency. For example, AI can analyse data from various sources (LAS, LCS, schools) to identify individuals who are at high risk of social issues, enabling early intervention and potentially preventing crises. 

 

Personalised Care Packages: AI can utilise predictive models to create personalised care packages in adult and children's social care, enhancing service quality while optimising resource allocation. This can help to provide more targeted and effective care, reducing unnecessary costs and improving outcomes for individuals. 

 

Road and Transport Maintenance: Machine Learning predictive analytics can pre-empt maintenance needs, saving on maintenance costs. For example, AI can analyse data from various sources to predict infrastructure issues such as potholes on roads. By predicting these issues before they become severe, the council can perform preventative maintenance, leading to cost savings in the long run. 

 

Emergency Planning & Community Safety: Monitor emails and transcripts of voice, freeing up human resources. Generative AI (Copilot,ChatGPT) can synthesise reports quickly, reducing administrative costs. For example, AI can analyse emails and voice channels to detect potential safety issues, enabling early intervention and potentially preventing accidents or crimes. 

 

Health, Welfare & Wellbeing Support: For tracking health trends and identifying needs for welfare services, improving resource allocation. For example, AI can analyse health data to identify individuals who are at high risk of health issues, enabling early intervention and potentially preventing health crises. 

 

These use cases are just the beginning. As we continue to develop our AI capabilities and learn from our AI initiatives, we expect to identify additional use cases that can deliver even greater benefits for the council and our residents. Some of these additional use cases were defined in the use cases prism below. In this prism we have categorised use cases into four quadrants, based on their feasibility and business value.  



AI Governance Framework 

 

While control and risk management are undeniably important with a governance, especially in the rapidly changing context of AI, we aim a better governance that doesn’t hinder ABC's potential. A balanced approach that prioritizes innovation and growth, while also considering risks, is essential for organizations to fully harness the transformative power of AI for the serve our residents better and build a better future workforce. 

 

ABC operates under tight budgetary constraints and budget gap requires a critical attention. By focusing on growth and innovation, ABC can identify cost-saving opportunities faster and allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring maximum value for residents. Additionally, an innovation-focused governance will allow ABC to leverage AI to improve our services and customer experience, making them more efficient and user-friendly. 

 

AI Governance Framework outlines the structures, processes, and principles we will use to ensure that our AI initiatives are ethical, responsible, and compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. This framework is based on the Data Ethics Framework and the AI Policy developed by involvement of IG and data teams, and it aligns with the UK National AI Strategy, Organisational Strategy, Digital Strategy, Data Strategy and other relevant guidelines and standards.

Governance Models Considered: 

  

Decentralised Model: Services have autonomy over their projects and tools. Although this might seem to promote agility and innovation but may lead to increased costs (shadow IT), duplication and inconsistencies and risks. 

Centralised Model: A single team or entity makes decisions. This ensures better consistency and compliance but may slow down decision-making. 

Hub and Spoke Model: A central team (hub) provides guidelines, and individual teams (spokes) work on their projects. This model combines the benefits of both centralised and decentralised models. 

 

 

It is proposed in this strategy that The Hub and Spoke model will be more suitable for ABC that combines the benefits of both centralised and decentralised model and to use our resources (human and technology) efficiently. The WG group (hub) with can ensure that best practices are followed, and resources are allocated efficiently. The individual teams (spokes) can then focus on their projects, ensuring agility and innovation. With the Hub and Spoke model, the central team can develop specialized AI models that can be used by multiple teams. This ensures that resources are used efficiently and that there's consistency in the AI solutions developed.
