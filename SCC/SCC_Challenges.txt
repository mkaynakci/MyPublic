Our county
As a place, Surrey has a range of unique features and qualities that can create different challenges and opportunities. The statistics and trends below set the strategic context that the council must navigate.

Population
Surrey has a population of 1.2 million residents, made up of approximately 481,800 households. This is expected to grow to 1.21 million by 2030.

Surrey is more urban than England as a whole but some areas of the county have large numbers of residents living rurally.

By 2030 the proportion of working age residents (16 to 64) and of younger people is expected to decrease while there are expected to be more residents aged over 65, and a 29% increase the number of over 85s.

Economy
Surrey has a strong economy worth £43.5 billion with a high (and increasing) proportion of large business, contrary to a national decline.

A low unemployment rate averaging about 2.1% in 2022, compared to 2.9% in the South East, and 3.6% nationally.

Residents in Surrey have average [full-time] earnings of £38,418pa (£42,770 for men and £34,066 for women), over £7,000 above national average.

Surrey has a high proportion of 'micro-businesses' at around 91.4%, compared to the national average of 89.5%.

Surrey is attractive to business with a 25% higher business density than the national average, but the rate of business births and growth in active businesses are falling in comparison to regional and national levels.

The middle workforce (aged 25 to 44), who make up a large proportion of the skilled workforce and are a key driver of economic growth is expected to 'decline by 8% by 2030', with signs of this decline already starting to show an impact. Despite this, Surrey still seeing a much higher rate of its residents employed as managers, directors, senior officials or professional occupations (63.8% compared to 51.4% nationally).

Cost of living
As the cost-of-living began to rise in 2022, a survey conducted in the summer found that around 66% of residents already reduced their energy usage to reduce cost and 63% of respondents said that the additional cost of fuel had negatively impacted their household finances.

Of the 4,197 clients seen by Surrey Citizens Advice between April – September 2022, 1,184 were new to their services. Support was given on approximately 7,000 issues, in particular around benefits, debt, housing and foodbanks.

This increased demand appears to be coming from particular groups within the county, with 66% of benefits claimants supported by Citizens Advice identifying as having a disability or long-term health condition, and two-thirds of clients identifying as female.

Demand for food support is also increasing, with some foodbanks across Surrey stating they have seen a 300% increase of demand on their services between 2020 and 2022.

Health and wellbeing
Surrey residents have longer life expectancies than people across most of England (approximately 2 years higher than the national average).

Life expectancy varies considerably across the county. Between wards there is a 10-year gap in life expectancy for males (76 to 86), and a 14 year gap for females (80 to 94).

Nationally, and in Surrey, average ratings of well-being have deteriorated across all indicators in the year ending March 2021, continuing a trend that was seen across most indicators in the previous period, but even more sharply and which notably takes place during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is most profoundly observed with mental health across the population.

Across Surrey in 2019, 5.36% of all-cause mortality was attributable to particulate air pollution. There is strong evidence that air pollution causes the development of coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer, exacerbates asthma and has a contributory role in mortality.

Ethnic minority groups typically have poorer health outcomes, and this is also the case in our county. Gypsy, Roma, Traveller (GRT) communities have the poorest health outcomes of any ethnic groups, in Surrey, in the UK, and internationally.

Evidence across England also suggests that LGBTQIA+ people have disproportionately worse health outcomes and experiences of healthcare.

Education and skills
According to the 2021 Census, nearly 286,000 children and young people live in Surrey. More than half of pupils achieve a strong pass (9-5) grade in English and Maths, compared to 43.4% nationally.

The county has a highly qualified workforce with over 50% of the working age population holding a degree-level qualification, with over 22% of residents employed in professional, technical and scientific businesses.

Pupils experiencing deprivation and those with additional needs are far less likely to do as well at school as their peers. There are generally low levels of deprivation in Surrey, but in some areas over 20% of children are impacted by poverty. As is the case across the UK, there is a growing demand for services for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities in all areas of the county.

Communities and partnerships
About 70% of residents believe there is a strong sense of community in their local area. This is reflected in the county's vibrant voluntary, community and faith sector, with approximately 6,000 organisations and thousands of residents volunteering each year.

Over 93.5% of people in Surrey recorded that they were satisfied with their neighbourhood as a place to live.

Surrey is one of the safest places in England and Wales, with the 6th lowest recorded crime rate of the 43 police forces, and lower than average rates of victim-based crime.

Reported knife crime among young people, however, has increased in the previous two years by 50%. In addition, domestic abuse has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic with recorded incidents being 16.7% higher in May 2020 than the same period the previous year.

Housing
There is very strong demand for all types of housing, homes and accommodation in Surrey. Average house prices in Surrey were £639,000 in 2022, placing it second only to Greater London for house prices.

However, the strongest demand is for affordable and social housing. In 2021 there were 14,134 households on the Surrey Housing Register, but only 4,711 social or affordable rent homes were built between 2011 and 2021.

Surrey is, on average, more unaffordable for private ownership than anywhere in the wider South East of England. It's also become more unaffordable more quickly, with the ratio rising 50% since 2011, compared to 40% across the wider South East.

There is also a rising problem with homelessness, which local authorities have been facing for some time. Across Surrey, in 2021/2022, 1,912 households were owed a prevention duty (assessed as threatened with homelessness), and 1,366 households were owed a relief duty (assessed as homeless).

Environment and infrastructure
Surrey has one of the busiest road networks in the country, which carry double the national average traffic flow (4th highest in the country) and make it the slowest county to drive around.

More than 40% of residents work outside the county with nearly a quarter working in London. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic additional capacity was needed on the train network to address overcrowding on commuter services.

Recycling rates in Surrey are better than the national average with 54.15% of household waste in Surrey being recycled, reused or composted in 2021 to 2022.

CO2 emissions have fallen 22% from 2016 to 2020, and whilst the rate of this drop has been increasing year-on-year, there are concerns we still won't meet the council's zero emissions target by 2050 for the county and need to fall by 46% against 2019 levels by 2025 to be on track for the target.

Road transport is the main cause of air pollution in Surrey, and transport emissions remain high with Surrey having the 4th highest level of transport-related emissions of all counties in England in 2020.

Residents do have good access to woodland spaces with an estimated 24% woodland cover in the county and a recent commitment by Surrey County Council to plant 1.2 milliontrees.
